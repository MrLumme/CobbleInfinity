From the modpack on Modrinth:

Spawning on a chest in the void, you are given only the things necessary to get the automation snowball rolling.
Requires the Create mod and a few add-ons to it, and uses a datapack, written specifically for this modpack. The datapack insures that (almost) everything can be made from cobblestone.
It was inspired by DejojoTheAwesome's video about cobblestone in Create.
