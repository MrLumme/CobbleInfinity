From the modpack on Modrinth:

Spawning on a chest in the void, you are given only the things necessary to get the automation snowball rolling.
Requires the Create mod and a few add-ons to it, and uses a datapack, written specifically for this modpack. The datapack insures that (almost) everything can be made from cobblestone.
It was inspired by DejojoTheAwesome's video about cobblestone in Create.

If you have trouble how to get started, I'd start by looking the recipes shown in JEI for the machines you have available.
Looking up haunting and milling recipes could be a good place to begin.
And if you are in doubt about how to get wood, I'd probably go touch some grass if I were you ;)
